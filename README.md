# Hi, I am Tabitha 🖐️🙂 ⌨️ 

I am an enthusiast about anything to do with humans connecting to technology in a meaningful way. My areas of interest ranges from UI/UX, Web design (HTML, CSS and JS) all the way to database programming (SQL).

I enjoy engaging in tech and coding commmunities, as it provides me with opportunities to not only engage with others, expanding my learning but also opportunities to share tips and tricks that I have accquired (and still do).
